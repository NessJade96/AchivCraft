# Wowchat

## User Story

1. AS a user I want to log in to the platform.
2. AS a logged in user I want to be able to follow characters
3. AS a logged in user I want to see my followed characters' most recent achievements on the home page.
4. AS a logged in user I want to be able to unfollow characters.
5. As a logged in user I want to be able to logout.

## pages:

Log in page
Home page (timeline showing recent character achievements)
Search page (displays table of characters to follow based on search)
User page (page to show who you follow - option to unfollow/remove)

### Endpoints I am defining for the app :)

1. Get Character/{RealmSlug}/{characterName}/achievements
   - This endpoint returns a summary of the achievements a character has completed.
2. Post Follow
   - Adds a character to the users account
   - payload contains: userID, RealmSlug, characterName, region
3.
