## think about what APIs 
### Endpoints I am defining for the app :)
1. Get Character/{RealmSlug}/{characterName}/achievements
    - This endpoint returns a summary of the achievements a character has completed.
2. Post Follow
    - Adds a character to the users account 
    - payload contains: userID, RealmSlug, characterName, region
